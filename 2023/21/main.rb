# You can see that whilst walking, the possible positions form a rhombus with right
# angles (a square rotated 45 deg).
# 
# Also note: (STEPS - SIZE/2) / SIZE is a nice round number: 202300.
# That means we have cycle of length SIZE with start SIZE/2.
# 
# After the first SIZE/2 steps, the corners of the rhombus are at the edge of the initial grid.
# After each next SIZE steps, the corners are at the edge of the next grid.
# 
# The rhombus is composed of:
# C. Four corner grids, which are filled as sosceles triangles: ^, >, v and <
# B. The edge grids (minus the corners), which are filled as right-angle triangles: \ and /
# A. The contained grids, which are completely filled
# 
# Whilst growing:
# - The number of C grids stays constant
# - The number of B grids grows linearly
# - The number of A grids growns quadratically
# 
# This very much looks like quadratic growth. Thus we hypothesize that the number of possible
# positions is based on a quadratic formula.
# The amout of positions can be given by f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where x is the number of cycles.
# To define a, b and c in , we need three points, so we calculate the positions for the first
# three cycles, which correspond to x = 0, x = 1 and x = 2.
